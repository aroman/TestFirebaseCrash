# How to run

1. Open this project with Unity 2021.2.0f1
2. Switch to Android build target
3. Build and run
4. The app will open, but shortly after opening, it will crash or hang (you can tell it hangs if the square freezes — it should normally move slowly down the screen. after a few seconds, Android system UI should tell you the app has stopped responding.)
